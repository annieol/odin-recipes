    <p><h3>Instructions</h3></p>
    <p><h4>Candied Pecans</h4></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350°f / 180°c. Spread the pecan
             halves out on a baking sheet, and toast for 8-10 
             minutes or until golden brown (you can snap one 
             open to check they are toasted throughout). Leave 
             to cool.</li>
        <li>Line a small baking sheet with a silicone baking
            mat or some parchment paper. In a medium saucepan
            over medium heat, combine the sugar, oil, and 
            salt.</li>
        <li>Add the toasted pecan halves and cook, stirring 
            frequently and adjusting the heat as necessary, 
            until the sugar has melted and the nuts are evenly 
            coated in the sugar mixture. Tip out onto the prepared 
            baking sheet and spread the nuts out with a spatula 
            so they aren’t clumped together.
